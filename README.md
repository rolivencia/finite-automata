# finite-automata
A C application that translates file-based finite automata into regular grammars and regular expressions. Both the source code and documentation is available in their original spanish versions.

This application was developed as an assigment for the Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages course, which is part of the Information Systems Engineering degree. The assignment was coded and delivered in november, 2009.

The included .exe file only runs in Windows XP (Service Pack 3) mode, if running a Windows version which is newer than XP SP3.
